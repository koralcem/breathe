- Add an intro view? Something like "Follow the bar..."

- Figure out launch screen: either something in LaunchScreen.xib, or see if you can use the main storyboard directly

- Figure out final colors in the UI

- Figure out final timings: defaults, and whether you want to allow up to 15 seconds on sliders

- Make icons: 58x58, 87x87, 80x80, 120x120, 120x120, 180x180
-- are some blurry?

- Register as iOS developer

- Look into Test Flight

- Publish
