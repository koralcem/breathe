- Change bar to be collapsed at load time and calcualte final bounds programmatically.
That way starting code can stay in viewDidAppear (needed because the views are given their final sizes there) but not
have the jarring initial collapse

- Final check

When first launched
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
applicationDidBecomeActive

hitting home button
applicationWillResignActive
applicationDidEnterBackground

Coming back without dying:
applicationWillEnterForeground
applicationDidBecomeActive

- Register as iOS developer

- Look into Test Flight

Q's for beta testers:
-- Are icons blurry on your device?
-- Would a stepper be better than a slider for numbers
-- When the app first launches, how soon does the "OK" button appear for you below the intro text? Is it weird?
-- Is the intro text OK?
-- Is the OK button at a comfortable height for your device/thumb combo?
-- Any other feedback?
