- Look into Test Flight

Q's for beta testers:
-- Are icons blurry on your device?
-- Would a stepper be better than a slider for numbers
-- When the app first launches, how soon does the "OK" button appear for you below the intro text? Is it weird?
-- Is the intro text OK?
-- Is the OK button at a comfortable height for your device/thumb combo?
-- Any other feedback?
