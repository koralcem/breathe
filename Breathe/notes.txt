- When you get backgrounded and restored, stuff doesn't continue!
-- Refactor layout stuff out of viewWillAppear into a helper.
-- Have viewwillappear call helper
-- Have the breath bar register as an observer for app becoming active, call helper when active

- Final bar calculations, and moving contents of viewDidAppear to viewWillAppear

- Final check

When first launched

========================================
- Register as iOS developer

- Look into Test Flight

Q's for beta testers:
-- Are icons blurry on your device?
-- Would a stepper be better than a slider for numbers
-- When the app first launches, how soon does the "OK" button appear for you below the intro text? Is it weird?
-- Is the intro text OK?
-- Is the OK button at a comfortable height for your device/thumb combo?
-- Any other feedback?
